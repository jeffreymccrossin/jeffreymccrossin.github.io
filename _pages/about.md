Jeffrey McCrossin, PhD, is a clinical social worker, couple and family therapist, and clinical supervisor who partners with families of neurodiverse children across hospital, community, and private practice settings. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Offord Centre for Child Studies (McMaster University) and was an invited visiting scholar at Université Paris Cité's Institut de Psychologie. He leads applied research on adapting the Family Check-Up model, caregiver peer support, and equity-focused implementation science in partnership with Indigenous and diverse communities.

His work spans clinical care, supervision, teaching, and scholarship—he maintains a private practice in the province of Quebec, supervises emerging clinicians, and teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in family therapy and social work. He has authored 13 peer-reviewed publications on family well-being, caregiver peer support, and neurodisability, and his contributions were recognized with awards including SSHRC, FRQS, and the Kids Brain Health Network Outstanding Promising Researcher Award.

Outside of research, he serves on community and research boards, organizes workshops on equitable engagement, and mentors trainees in inclusive and resilient family-centred practice. Please feel free to reach out by email for research, supervision, or clinical collaboration inquiries.
